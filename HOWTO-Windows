In Windows there are multiple ways to build this project. Obviously there are Release and Debug variants, but the more significant types are the .exe and .dll (actually .xll, for use as an excel plugin) variants as well as their x86, and x64 flavours. These can all be built with the free Microsoft Visual Studio IDE (although you'll likely have to install the Windows Development Kit for the x64 targets - but I'm not sure).

*** Compiling with Visual Studio

*** Compiling with WinDDK

If you compile with the Visual Studio IDE you will require anyone that uses your compiled code to also install a runtime library - which version will depend upon which version of the IDE you compiled the code with. There is a way to relax the requirement of installing a redistributable (say, for locked-down machine environments) but requires using an alternate compiler from Microsoft - the Device Driver Kit (sometimes called the WindDDK). It is not a visual compilation environment but a command line environment which you might have trouble getting used to. The real bonus is that you'll be able to mak excel plugins that don't require the installation of extra stuff.

Sadly, ohdp's A branch has not yet been setup to compile with the WinDDK. I seem to remember to recall it was a bit of work, but it can be done. The alternative is for you to evaluate the performance of ohdp's B branch to see if it works for you. It is all setup to compile with the WinDDK.
