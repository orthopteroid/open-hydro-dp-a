The Windows DDK comes with a really good compiler that can target x86, x64, ia32, ia64 architectures and multiple OS flavors of Windows. You might not have used it before, so I'm providing a brief introduction.

Download and install the Windows Device Driver Kit. The one on my machine is a bit older (7600.16385.1) but it'll work to provide examples. When you install it, it'll go into a directory like:

c:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1

So, open an command prompt, cd to that directory and run setenv.bat with some args to specify what kind of build you will be making (ie, a checked or free build, an x86, x64, ia32, ia64 target processor and the target OS). So, type:

cd c:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\bin
setenv c:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1 fre x64 win7

Now you can cd to your local folder where you have the .c files and run build:

cd c:\HydroDPa\src
build
